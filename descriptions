1. discoloration
    1.1 Whole leaf : Equal, or nearing equal distrubution of discoloration across the entire leaf

    1.2 Interveinal: discoloration that occurs in between the veins. Veins refer to the tiny hair like structures 
        that branch of the main midrib (the main vein running vertically in the center of the leaf). The discoloration 
        ends before touching the veins itself, creating a stripe like pattern vertically across the leaflets. Interveinal 
        discoloration should not be confused with spots.

    1.3 Tip to base: a gradient of discoloration that starts at the tips of the leaflets and reduces in strength as it approaches the leaf base. 
    
    1.4 Base to tip: a gradient of discoloration that starts at the base of the leaf and reduces in strength as it approaches the leaf tips. 
    
    1.5 Edges to inwards: a gradient of discoloration that starts at the edges and tips of the leaflets and reduces in strength as it approaches the midribs of the leaflets.

    1.6 Inward to edges: a gradient of discoloration that starts from the midrib of the leaflets and reduces in strength as it approaches the edges and leaftips of the leaflets.

    *   1.7 Necrotic tips: Necrotic tips appear brown or grey in color, and differ from normal discoloration in that the leaf material is thin and dry, and generally looks dead.

    *   1.8 Necrotic edges: Necrotic edges appear brown or grey in color, and differ from normal discoloration in that the leaf material is thin and dry, and generally looks dead.

Boron Deficiency

- Boron is an immobile micronutrient that is an essential building block for cellmembranes, 
  has a function in celldivision and is involved in regulation of multiple other metabolic pathways. 
  Boron deficiency can lead to reduced turgor, reduced fertility, reduced vegatative and reproductive 
  growth and can kill meristem tisues.
- Boron is needed in very small quantities, and is usually present in large enough quantities in most soils. 
  A deficiency is usually the result of underwatering your plant. Before you start pooring buckets of water 
  into your soil, make sure the symptoms are different to that of calcium shortage.
